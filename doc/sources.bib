  abstract = {When Communications of the ACM began publication in 1959, the members of ACM's Editorial Board made the following remark as they described the purposes of ACM's periodicals [2]: “If computer programming is to become an important part of computer research and development, a transition of programming from an art to a disciplined science must be effected.” Such a goal has been a continually recurring theme during the ensuing years; for example, we read in 1970 of the “first steps toward transforming the art of programming into a science” [26]. Meanwhile we have actually succeeded in making our discipline a science, and in a remarkably simple way: merely by deciding to call it “computer science.”},

@techreport{Parnas1971,
  abstract = {{The role of documentation in the design and implementation of complex systems is explored, resulting in suggestions in sharp contrast with current practice. The concept of system structure is studied by examining the meaning of the phrase 'connections between modules.' It is shown that several system design goals (each suggesting a partial time ordering of the decisions) may be inconsistent. Some properties of programmers are discussed. System documentation, which makes all information accessible to anyone working on the project, is discussed. The thesis that such information 'broadcasting' is harmful, that it is helpful if most system information is hidden from most programmers, is supported by use of the above mentioned considerations as well as by examples. An information hiding technique of documentation is given in the appendix. (Author)}},
